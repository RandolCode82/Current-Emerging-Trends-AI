Project Reflection: Pirate Intelligent Agent (Deep Q‑Learning)
Overview of the Work Completed
For this project, I implemented a deep Q‑learning intelligent agent designed to guide a pirate character through a maze to locate treasure. The starter code provided the basic environment setup, including the grid layout, reward structure, and movement rules. I expanded this foundation by creating the neural network model, implementing the Q‑learning update logic, designing the qtrain() training loop, and integrating experience replay to stabilize learning. I also added detailed inline comments, tuned hyperparameters, and ensured that the agent’s behavior converged toward an optimal policy without runtime errors.

Connection to the Field of Computer Science
This project reinforced how computer scientists solve problems by breaking them into smaller components, designing algorithms, and iterating through testing and refinement. Reinforcement learning mirrors this mindset: the agent explores, evaluates outcomes, and improves through feedback. More broadly, computer scientists build systems that automate decision‑making, optimize processes, and create tools that scale beyond human capability. Projects like this one demonstrate why the field matters—intelligent agents can support industries such as robotics, healthcare, logistics, and game development by learning from data rather than relying solely on hard‑coded rules.

My Approach to Problem‑Solving as a Computer Scientist
Working on this project strengthened my ability to approach problems systematically. I began by understanding the environment and constraints, then identified which components required new logic or architecture. I used debugging, incremental testing, and visualization of training progress to verify that the agent was learning correctly. When issues arose—such as unstable Q‑values or slow convergence—I revisited the reward structure, learning rate, and exploration strategy. This iterative, analytical approach reflects how computer scientists tackle complex challenges: through experimentation, evaluation, and continuous refinement.

Ethical Responsibilities to Users and Organizations
Developing intelligent systems carries important ethical responsibilities. For end users, I must ensure that AI behaves predictably, avoids harmful actions, and respects user autonomy. Transparency is essential—users should understand how decisions are made and what data is being used. For organizations, I must ensure that models are reliable, secure, and free from unintended bias. Even in a game‑based project like this one, the principles scale to real‑world applications: reinforcement‑learning agents must be trained responsibly, tested thoroughly, and deployed with safeguards that prevent misuse or unexpected behavior.
